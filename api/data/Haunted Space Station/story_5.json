    "prologue": "A distress signal, faint and garbled, crackled through the void. It emanated from the 'Aethelred,' a research vessel that vanished years ago near the infamous Xylos Nebula. Legends spoke of strange lights and unsettling whispers surrounding the nebula, tales dismissed as space-faring folklore. But this signal, however weak, was real. Your mission: pilot a small scout ship to the Aethelred, investigate the disappearance of its crew, and if possible, bring back any survivors or vital data. The ship is drifting, its outer hull scarred by micrometeorites and something\u2026 else. An eerie silence hangs in space, broken only by the hum of your own ship. The Aethelred awaits, a ghost in the cosmic dark, and you are its only hope.",
