    "prologue": "You are Captain Nova, commander of the starship 'Stardust Explorer'. Your mission: a daring rescue on the abandoned research station 'Xylos Prime'. Years ago, Xylos Prime vanished from all star charts, shrouded in mystery and whispers of strange cosmic energies. Now, a faint distress signal has been detected, originating from the derelict station. A brave, but perhaps slightly clumsy, scientist, Dr. Quibble, is believed to be trapped aboard. You and your trusty droid companion, Bolt, are the only ones brave enough to venture into the unknown. The 'Stardust Explorer' docks with the silent station, its lights flickering erratically. Prepare yourselves for an adventure into the heart of cosmic strangeness!",

Strange, bioluminescent fungi pulse softly on the walls, casting eerie green and blue light. The floor is littered with discarded equipment and strange, gelatinous puddles. A faint, rhythmic humming fills the air, making the metal deck vibrate slightly.",

Luminescent flora casts an otherworldly glow, hinting at the strange phenomena that may have befallen this place. Your mission is clear: find Dr. Quibble and get out safely. But first, you must navigate these alien-infused halls.",
