Rain slicks the streets, reflecting the vibrant, hurried world above. You are Spark, a young, ambitious cyber-detective with a knack for finding things others miss. Your trusty companion, a chirping drone named Glitch, hovers nearby.  A mysterious message has arrived, hinting at a secret that could shake the city's foundations. A powerful corporation, OmniCorp, is at the center of it all, but their secrets are buried deep within the city's underbelly. It's time to dive into the shadows and uncover the truth.",
