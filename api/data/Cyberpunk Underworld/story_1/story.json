    "prologue": "The neon glow of Neo-Veridia slicked the rain-soaked streets, reflecting off your trench coat. You are Detective Kaito, a private investigator known for sniffing out trouble in the city's underbelly. A mysterious client, shrouded in digital static, hired you to uncover a dark secret hidden within the monolithic towers of OmniCorp. They say OmniCorp controls everything, from the city's power grid to its favorite noodle stands. But whispers of a conspiracy, something about stolen dreams and manufactured memories, have reached your ears. Tonight, the rain washes away the usual grime, but it can't wash away the unsettling feeling that something big is about to unfold. Your only clue is a data chip humming with secrets, dropped by a shadowy figure in the alley.",
