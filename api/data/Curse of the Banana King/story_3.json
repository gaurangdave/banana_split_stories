    "prologue": "Brave adventurer, legend speaks of the mythical Golden Banana, hidden deep within the Temple of the Watchful Trees. This isn't just any banana; it's said to grant the eater eternal giggles and the ability to float! For centuries, it has been guarded by the ancient Banana King, whose curse causes the very banana trees to peer with leafy eyes at any who dare approach. You've heard the whispers, seen the faded maps, and your heart beats with the thrill of discovery. You've journeyed for days, and now, the vine-covered entrance to the temple looms before you. The air is thick with the sweet scent of ripe fruit and a hint of ancient mystery. Are you ready to embark on this slightly absurd, yet thrilling, treasure hunt?",
